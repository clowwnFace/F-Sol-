# Lesson Reflection

Hello,

I hope you've been doing well. I recently took a short break to rest my head and solidify my understanding of the concepts I've been learning.

In this latest lesson, I delved into the intricacies of creating a full-stack decentralized application (DApp). It was fascinating to unravel how DApps function and the technologies that power them.

Key takeaways from the lesson include:
- Understanding how MetaMask integrates with web browsers.
- Exploring function selectors, cast sig, and other essential concepts.

Even though this lesson was brief, it provided a comprehensive overview of the DApp development process. I'm excited about the prospect of applying this knowledge in the next lesson.

Looking forward to the upcoming challenges and learning opportunities.

See you in the next lesson!
