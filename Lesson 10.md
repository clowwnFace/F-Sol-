# Lesson Reflection

In this lesson, I jumped in with the goal of gaining a solid understanding of ERC20 tokens.

Here's a snapshot of what I covered:
- Explored the fundamentals of ERC (Ethereum Request for Comments) and EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal).
- Delved into different forms of ERC20 tokens, such as ERC677 and ERC777.
- Learned the process of manually creating a token and discovered easier methods using ERC20 token contracts like OpenZeppelin and Solmate.
- Explored writing tests for the created tokens and even dabbled in using artificial intelligence to streamline the testing process.

Excited about the progress and looking forward to achieving more in the upcoming lessons!

Cheers to continuous learning! ðŸš€
